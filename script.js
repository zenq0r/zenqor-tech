/**
 * ZENQOR TECHNOLOGIES - ENTERPRISE CORE SCRIPT
 * Dynamic Navigation, UI Animations, Translations, and Live CMS Content
 *
 * CHANGES IN THIS VERSION (see accompanying summary for full audit):
 *  - Firestore `content/site_text` now merges into the translations table
 *    BEFORE setLanguage() runs, so every element with data-i18n (and now
 *    data-i18n-placeholder) is editable from the admin dashboard's new
 *    "Page Text" section — no per-page HTML changes needed to add a new
 *    editable field, just add the key to the admin's key list.
 *  - data-i18n-placeholder was previously declared on the contact form but
 *    never actually applied — fixed.
 *  - config/company_profile now actually gets read and injected into every
 *    page's footer (registration no., address) and the floating WhatsApp
 *    widget, plus contact.html's primary address/email/phone block.
 *  - config/system_settings.maintenance now actually locks the site when
 *    turned on (previously this admin field did nothing).

    // interpolated into innerHTML — content/config Firestore docs are only

    // cookie_text, tos_content, rp_content, etc.) containing hand-authored markup
    // like <br>, <strong>, and <a href="...">. Firestore content/site_text lets an
    // admin override those same keys, at the same trust level, so a blanket
    // escapeHtml() would both break the legitimate markup AND still leave a
    // compromised admin account (or admin-dashboard bug) able to inject arbitrary
    // script via innerHTML. Instead, allowlist-sanitize: keep only the small set
    // of tags/attributes these fields actually use, drop everything else down to
    // plain text, and block unsafe href schemes (javascript:, data:, etc.).
